      <p>Born and raised in a city that goes by the name Tbilisi, located in The The Republic of Georgia. Came to America to follow my young dreams of working in the Casino industry. Started from the bottom and worked my way up to becoming a pit Manager as I got close to my eleventh year in the business. Along the way I established a family and my dreams shifted into wanting to better myself and work in a new profession to better myself and my family.</a></p>
